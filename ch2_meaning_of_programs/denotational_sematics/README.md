# Denotional Semantics

Where operational sematics explain the meaning of a language/program by evaluating what expressions and statements result in (big step sematics), or what steps are required for a machine to compute the result (small step sematics), Denotional sematics are used to translate a program to a different language. That language could be another computer language that has formal sematics in place (or is very familiar to many), or even a human language such as english. More commonly these denotions would be written in a form of mathimatical objects using Domain Theroy.

In the examples here, the denotions are in Ruby. This can be a little confusing as both the metalanguage and the denotions are in Ruby, so try to think about the translation happening from SIMPLE to Ruby (which is what we want).
